* How to linux
  - This guide is written to show a friend ~da wae~
* Audience
  - not a computer science student or crazy linux autist
  - electrical engineer probably working on embedded hardware
* Context
  - My guess is that you wanna dive into linux but have no idea what
    to do or learn?
  - So I will define some objectives for you.
  - My assumption is that you want to get comfortable working in linux
  - to do so you need some basics
    - terminal-fu!
      - navigation
      - text editing
* Operating System
  Arch linux is great for learning but it is a chore to setup and
  debug. And considering that you are a electrical engineer, I think
  you would likely work in ~Ubuntu~ so lets start from there.
* Things to do on Ubuntu
  1. Setup and ricing
     I think configuring the OS to your liking is fun and in the
     process you will learn somethings about working in linux in
     general.
     1. The default things that came with ubuntu sucks
* Assignments/Exercises
** Better shell, install and change default shell to fish

** Learn vim
   - I use emacs now but I think vim would be more suitable for an
   electrical engineer.
   - I am sorry but I don't know how I learnt vim. I just used it and
   it soon became muscle memory
   - Try printing out the keyboard shortcuts picture and placing it on
     your table, http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif
** Learn to read and setup github project instructions
   - go install this https://github.com/amix/vimrc
** Use Ranger
